# Collection of test cases for svg spec conformance

Uses next.js and react-native, with svgs and react-native-svg.

# Idea
Single code-base cross-platform stack, using svg for rendering, js for logic, jsx/react for components. Enabling use of svg exported from e.g. illustrator as foundation and to easily make purely functional components from them.
